    "**The Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad Question (#2)**: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "- **Specific question: Can player's age, gender, and experience predict whether they are in the top 25% of total play time?** (whether they are going to contribute significantly to the experiement or not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**More About The Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since I saw that the newsletter subscribers category is **not a good proxy of contribution and is rather a proxy for interest**. I wanted to examine how the experiments stakeholders can **improve their recruitment practices to get more players who can contribute more significantly to their project without inducing bias** to their selection process.\n",
    "- I have chosen top 25% as to present this data into **four quartiles**, this makes it easier to communicate the significance of the result (if any) to the stakeholders. I also cannot chose a random cuttoff for played_time (say at an hour) as it has no innate meaning neither does it relate to the dataset in a meaningful manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How The Data Helps Answer The Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to proposing using quartile-based definition for heavy contributors, (with heavy contributor defined as someone in the top 25% of `played_hours`), age, gender, and experience can be used to predict a binary label response variable. In this case, the explanatory variables serve in our prediction model but also allow the stakeholders to better formulate targeted recruiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrangling Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Will be creating a label `heavy_contributor` and will assign it a binary value of 1 given that the player is in the top quratile of contributors.\n",
    "2. Will handle any missing cells for all explanatory variables and the response variable.\n",
    "3. Will not be using the following variables `name` and `hashedEmail` and so will be dropping them to tidy the dataset further.\n",
    "4. Will regroup non-Male/non-Female gender levels into `Other` to stabilize the variable.\n",
    "5. Will split the data into training and testing data sets, with the split going 80:20 as this gives the model ~10 true positive cases of `heavy_contributor`.\n",
    "6. Will stratify the training data using 5-fold cross-validation."

Linear regression has no major hyperparameters to tune, unlike k-NN which requires careful selection of the number of neighbors and scaling of all numeric variables. The model is quick to train, easy to validate, and fits well into a cross-validation framework where we can also pick the best classification threshold.

Furthermore, I will merge sparse categorical subgroups/levels (e.g. less represented and more sparse gender groups into \"Other\") to reduce noise and instability when training the model.\n",

    "Cross-validation is a resampling method used to assess how a predictive model will generalize to an independent dataset. It is especially important in this case since the dataset is limited to ~196 players, where holding out a large test set would reduce the data available for training. I will use 5-fold cross-validation. While in k-NN classifiers, cross-validation will primarly be used to tune the hyperparamtere k, in linear regression, cross-validation helps to verify model stability across different subsets of the data, quantify any generalization error and reduce the risk of overfitting.
